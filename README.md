# Description of the problem and a discussion of the background.
A Mexican taco chain wants to open a location in downtown LA. As we know, Los Angeles is one of the cities with the most Mexicans in the US.
Opening a good taco restaurant in downtown LA would have a great impact due to the lack of traditional Mexican food in the US, Mexican cuisine is very famous but due to the lack of opportunities the Tex-mex food industry has taken all the market.
Goal: Find a key location where this taco chain would be succesful. 

# Description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. 
1. We will search for the best Mexican Restaurants all over Los Angeles.
2. We segment these restaurants and analyze the areas that are most concurred.
3. Knowing the most popular areas, we find a specific spot where the new restaurant can be placed.
It is important to consider that the new restaurant location must be a little far from the other ones so it can gain new popularity.
The location must have an easy access to it.
